# Phrase-Hunter
In this project, JavaScript and object-oriented programming are used to select a random hidden phrase, that a player tries to guess. 
Using JavaScript, the phrase is split into letters and displayed on the gameboard.
A player has 5 tries to guess a correct letter in the phrase. If the guess is correct, the letter is displayed on the screen
A letter can be guessed only once, and is disabled on the onscreen keyboard after the players guess.
If the player guesses the phrase before they run out of tries, a winner's screen is displayed.
If the player makes 5 incorrect guesses, a losing screen is displayed.
Event listener was added to allow players to enter a guess, using the physical keyboard on their computer.
Animations/keyframes were added to the CSS to have the title and start button fade-in, and the title move-in from the left, and the start button move-in from the right.
